BIBBL SYSLOG TLS CERTIFICATES FOR VERSA SD-WAN
================================================

This bundle contains the TLS certificates needed to configure Versa SD-WAN Director
to send logs to Bibbl Log Stream over secure syslog (TLS).

FILES INCLUDED:
---------------
1. bibbl-syslog.crt       - Server certificate (PEM format)
2. bibbl-syslog-ca.pem    - CA bundle (PEM format)

VERSA DIRECTOR CONFIGURATION:
-----------------------------
In Versa Director GUI:

1. Navigate to: Analytics > Administration > Configurations > Log Collector Exporter
2. Select the "Remote Collector" tab
3. Click "+ Add" to create a new remote collector
4. Configure the following fields:

   Name:                 bibbl-tls-collector
   Description:          Bibbl Log Stream via TLS
   Destination Address:  <Bibbl server IP or hostname>
   Destination Port:     6514 (or your configured syslog TLS port)
   Type:                 TCP
   Transport:            TLS (Enable TLS checkbox)
   Template:             <Select your syslog template>

5. TLS Configuration:
   - Upload bibbl-syslog-ca.pem to the "CA Certificate" field
   - Leave "Client Certificate" and "Private Key" empty (one-way TLS)
   - Note: Versa requires certificates in PEM format
   - Note: Versa does NOT support certificate chains

6. Click "Save Changes"

7. Create exporter rules to route logs to this collector:
   - Navigate to "Exporter Rules" tab
   - Add rule matching your log types
   - Set "Remote Collector Profile" to reference your new collector

SECURITY NOTES:
---------------
- The private key (bibbl-syslog.key) is NOT included in this bundle for security
- These certificates use one-way TLS (server authentication only)
- For mutual TLS, Versa would need to generate its own client certificate
- Keep your private keys secure and never upload them to network appliances

VERSA DOCUMENTATION:
--------------------
For detailed configuration steps, refer to:
https://docs.versa-networks.com/Management_and_Orchestration/Versa_Analytics/Configuration/Configure_Log_Collectors_and_Log_Exporter_Rules

Specifically the section: "Configure a Remote Collector" with TLS enabled.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- Verify Bibbl is listening on the configured port: netstat -tuln | grep 6514
- Check Versa Analytics logs: /var/log/syslog on the Analytics node
- Test connectivity: openssl s_client -connect <bibbl-ip>:6514
- Ensure firewall allows TCP port 6514 between Versa and Bibbl
